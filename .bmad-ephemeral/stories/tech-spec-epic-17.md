# Epic Technical Specification: Cloud Logging Integration

Date: 2026-01-17
Author: Ankit
Epic ID: 17
Status: Draft

---

## Overview

Epic 17 addresses a critical operational gap in Annie's production deployment: the lack of remote log visibility and proactive alerting. Currently, Annie's architecture (as defined in the Architecture Plan) uses Docker Compose with structured JSON logging to stdout, but logs are only accessible via SSH or `docker compose logs`. This epic implements environment-aware cloud logging using Grafana Cloud's free tier with the Loki Docker logging driver, enabling remote debugging and proactive alerting without any application code changes.

This aligns with the PRD's technical metrics goals (99%+ uptime, <1% error rate) by providing the observability infrastructure needed to detect and respond to issues before they impact users.

## Objectives and Scope

### In Scope

- **Production Docker Compose Override**: Create `docker-compose.prod.yml` with Loki logging driver configuration for all four services (backend, mcp-server, telegram-bot, redis)
- **Environment-Aware Startup**: Modify `scripts/run_docker.sh` to detect `ENV` variable and apply appropriate compose configuration
- **Makefile Integration**: Update Makefile commands (`stop`, `logs`, `rebuild`, `health`, `shell`) to respect `ENV` variable
- **Environment Configuration**: Add `LOKI_URL` to `env.example` and document in `CLAUDE.md`
- **Alerting Documentation**: Create `docs/operations/ALERTING.md` with LogQL queries and setup instructions
- **Validation**: End-to-end testing of both development and production modes

### Out of Scope

- Prometheus metrics collection (future consideration)
- Distributed tracing integration with Langfuse (future consideration)
- Multi-environment support (staging) beyond dev/prod
- Custom Grafana dashboards (manual setup in Grafana Cloud UI)
- Log sampling or filtering at source

## System Architecture Alignment

This epic extends Annie's existing Docker Compose architecture without modifying the core service communication patterns:

**Components Referenced**:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Base configuration (unchanged)
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - New production override file
- `scripts/run_docker.sh` - Startup script (modified)
- `Makefile` - Build commands (modified)

**Architecture Constraints**:
- Zero application code changes required
- Logging configuration at Docker daemon level via logging driver
- Environment detection via `ENV` shell variable (consistent with existing `ENV` pattern for GitHub commands)
- Fail-fast behavior in production mode if prerequisites not met

**Service Impact**:
| Service | Change |
|---------|--------|
| backend | Logging driver override in prod |
| mcp-server | Logging driver override in prod |
| telegram-bot | Logging driver override in prod |
| redis | Logging driver override in prod |

## Detailed Design

### Services and Modules

| Component | Responsibility | Inputs | Outputs | Owner |
|-----------|----------------|--------|---------|-------|
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Define Loki logging driver configuration for all services | `LOKI_URL` env var | Logging config applied to containers | DevOps |
| `run_docker.sh` | Environment detection, prerequisite validation, service startup | `ENV` variable, `.env` file | Running containers with correct logging | DevOps |
| `Makefile` | Unified command interface respecting environment | `ENV` variable | Correct compose file selection | DevOps |
| Loki Docker Plugin | Ship container logs to Grafana Cloud | Container stdout/stderr | HTTPS POST to Loki endpoint | External |
| Grafana Cloud | Log aggregation, querying, alerting | Log streams | UI, alerts, API | External |

### Data Models and Contracts

**Log Entry Structure** (existing, unchanged):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-17T10:30:00.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Tool call completed",
  "service": "backend",
  "request_id": "abc123",
  "extra": {
    "tool_name": "web_search",
    "duration_ms": 145
  }
}
```

**Loki Labels** (added by logging driver):
```yaml
labels:
  service: "backend"      # From loki-external-labels
  env: "prod"             # From loki-external-labels
  project: "annie"        # From loki-external-labels
  container_name: "annie-backend-1"  # Auto-added by driver
  compose_service: "backend"         # Auto-added by driver
```

**Environment Variables Contract**:
| Variable | Required | Default | Format |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| `ENV` | No | `dev` | `dev` or `prod` |
| `LOKI_URL` | Yes (prod only) | - | `https://<user>:<key>@<host>/loki/api/v1/push` |

### APIs and Interfaces

**No new application APIs** - this epic operates at infrastructure level.

**External API: Grafana Loki Push API**
- **Endpoint**: `https://logs-prod-us-central1.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push`
- **Method**: POST
- **Auth**: Basic auth embedded in URL (user-id:api-key)
- **Format**: Protobuf (handled by Loki driver)
- **Rate Limit**: None for free tier (volume-based billing)

**Makefile Interface Changes**:
```makefile
# All commands now accept ENV parameter
make start              # Dev mode (default)
make start ENV=prod     # Prod mode with Loki
make stop ENV=prod      # Stop prod containers
make logs ENV=prod      # View prod container logs
make health ENV=prod    # Check prod health
make check-loki         # Verify Loki plugin installed
```

### Workflows and Sequencing

**Production Startup Sequence**:
```
1. User runs: make start ENV=prod
       ↓
2. Makefile invokes: ./scripts/run_docker.sh
       ↓
3. run_docker.sh detects ENV=prod
       ↓
4. check_docker() - Verify Docker installed
       ↓
5. check_docker_compose() - Verify Compose available
       ↓
6. create_env_file() - Ensure .env exists
       ↓
7. validate_env() - Check required vars
       ↓
8. [PROD ONLY] check_loki_plugin() - Verify Loki driver installed
       ↓ FAIL → Exit with install instructions
9. [PROD ONLY] validate_prod_env() - Verify LOKI_URL set
       ↓ FAIL → Exit with configuration instructions
10. start_services() with -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml
       ↓
11. Containers start with Loki logging driver
       ↓
12. Logs flow to Grafana Cloud
```

**Log Flow (Production)**:
```
Container Process
    ↓ stdout/stderr
Docker Daemon
    ↓ Loki logging driver
Batching (400 entries or 2s timeout)
    ↓ HTTPS POST
Grafana Cloud Loki
    ↓ Indexed by labels
LogQL Queries / Alerts
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

| Metric | Target | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Log delivery latency | <5s p95 | Epic 17 Success Criteria |
| Container startup overhead | <2s additional | Loki driver initialization |
| Loki driver memory footprint | <50MB per container | Grafana documentation |
| Batch size | 400 entries | Configured in compose |
| Batch timeout | 2s | Configured in compose |

**Impact on Application Performance**:
- Logging driver operates asynchronously; no blocking on application threads
- Batch buffering prevents per-log-line network calls
- Retry mechanism (5 retries) handles transient network issues without log loss

**Alignment with PRD**: Supports the 99%+ uptime goal by enabling proactive issue detection. No impact on the <2s response time (p95) requirement as logging is non-blocking.

### Security

| Requirement | Implementation | Source |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Credential protection | `LOKI_URL` in `.env` (gitignored) | Standard secrets management |
| Transport encryption | HTTPS only (TLS 1.2+) | Grafana Cloud enforced |
| Log data sensitivity | Existing `SENSITIVE_VARS` masking applies | Architecture Plan - Logging section |
| Access control | Grafana Cloud account authentication | External service |

**Threat Considerations**:
- **Credential leak**: `LOKI_URL` contains embedded API key. Mitigated by `.gitignore` and environment variable pattern (not hardcoded)
- **Log injection**: N/A - logs are structured JSON from application, not user-controlled
- **Data exfiltration**: Logs may contain user_id and conversation context. Existing masking covers API keys. No PII changes required for V1.

### Reliability/Availability

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Graceful degradation | If Loki unavailable, logs still written to container stdout (queryable locally) |
| Retry on failure | Loki driver retries 5 times with backoff |
| No single point of failure | Logging failure does not crash application |
| Dev mode fallback | `ENV=dev` bypasses all Loki requirements |

**Failure Scenarios**:
| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Grafana Cloud outage | Logs buffered locally, may be lost if buffer fills |
| Network timeout | Driver retries 5 times, then drops batch |
| Invalid LOKI_URL | Startup fails fast with clear error message |
| Loki plugin not installed | Startup fails fast with install instructions |

**Recovery**: No manual intervention needed for transient failures. Persistent failures require checking Grafana Cloud status or network connectivity.

### Observability

| Signal | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Log aggregation | Grafana Cloud Loki with LogQL queries |
| Log retention | 14 days (free tier) |
| Alerting | Grafana Cloud Alerting (50 rules, free tier) |
| Dashboards | Manual creation in Grafana Cloud UI |

**Required LogQL Queries** (documented in `docs/operations/ALERTING.md`):
```logql
# Error rate by service
sum by (service) (count_over_time({project="annie"} |= "ERROR" [5m]))

# Memory storage failures
{service="backend"} |= "MemoryClient" |= "failed"

# LLM latency outliers
{service="backend"} | json | duration_ms > 5000

# Tool call errors
{service="mcp-server"} |= "error" |= "tool"
```

**Recommended Alerts**:
| Alert | Condition | Severity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Service Error Spike | >10 errors in 5 min | Critical |
| Memory Storage Failed | Any occurrence | Critical |
| Redis Connection Lost | Any occurrence | Critical |
| LLM Latency High | >5 occurrences/hour | Warning |

## Dependencies and Integrations

### External Service Dependencies

| Service | Version/Tier | Purpose | Required |
|---------|--------------|---------|----------|
| Grafana Cloud | Free tier | Log aggregation, alerting | Yes (prod) |
| Loki Docker Plugin | `grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest` | Log shipping | Yes (prod) |

### Infrastructure Dependencies

| Component | Version | Constraint | Notes |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------|
| Docker | 20.10+ | Minimum for Loki plugin | Validated in `run_docker.sh` |
| Docker Compose | v2 (preferred) or v1 | Compose file override support | Auto-detected |
| Linux/macOS | Any | Docker plugin support | Windows requires WSL2 |

### Python Package Dependencies

**No new Python dependencies required.** This epic operates entirely at the Docker/infrastructure level.

Existing dependency manifests (unchanged):
- `backend/requirements.txt`
- `mcp_server/requirements.txt`
- `telegram_bot/requirements.txt`

### File Dependencies

| File | Type | Dependency |
|------|------|------------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Existing | Base configuration (not modified) |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | New | Requires `docker-compose.yml` as base |
| `.env` | Existing | Must contain `LOKI_URL` for prod mode |
| `scripts/run_docker.sh` | Modified | No new file dependencies |
| `Makefile` | Modified | No new file dependencies |

### Integration Points

| Integration | Direction | Protocol | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Docker Daemon → Loki Plugin | Internal | Plugin API | Managed by Docker |
| Loki Plugin → Grafana Cloud | Outbound | HTTPS | Port 443, no firewall changes needed |
| Grafana Cloud → Email | Outbound | SMTP | Alert notifications (managed by Grafana) |

### Grafana Cloud Setup Requirements

1. **Account Creation**: https://grafana.com/products/cloud/ (free tier)
2. **Loki Data Source**: Auto-provisioned with account
3. **Push URL**: Connections → Hosted Logs → Loki → Details
4. **API Key**: Embedded in push URL (no separate key management)

### Version Constraints

```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml compatibility
version: "3.8"  # Minimum for x-* anchor syntax

# Loki plugin
loki-docker-driver: latest  # Tracks Grafana releases

# Grafana Cloud
API: v1  # Loki Push API
```

## Risks, Assumptions, Open Questions

### Risks

| ID | Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|----|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| R1 | Grafana Cloud free tier discontinued | High | Low | Volume estimates show minimal usage; paid tier is affordable ($0.50/GB) |
| R2 | Loki Docker plugin incompatible with future Docker versions | Medium | Low | Plugin maintained by Grafana; fallback to Promtail sidecar if needed |
| R3 | LOKI_URL credential accidentally committed | High | Low | `.env` already in `.gitignore`; pre-commit hooks could add extra protection |
| R4 | Log buffer overflow during Grafana outage | Low | Low | Acceptable risk for personal project; logs still in container during runtime |

### Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Validation |
|----|------------|------------|
| A1 | Docker 20.10+ is available on production host | Validated in `run_docker.sh` |
| A2 | Production host has outbound HTTPS (443) access | Standard for cloud deployments |
| A3 | Grafana Cloud free tier limits (50GB/month) are sufficient | Volume estimate: ~250MB/month (0.5% of limit) |
| A4 | Single user (Ankit) is sole Grafana Cloud admin | Personal project scope |
| A5 | Existing structured JSON logging format is compatible with Loki | Loki accepts any text; JSON enables structured queries |

### Open Questions

| ID | Question | Owner | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------|
| Q1 | Should we add Prometheus metrics in a future epic? | Ankit | Deferred to future consideration |
| Q2 | Do we need log retention beyond 14 days? | Ankit | No - 14 days sufficient for debugging |
| Q3 | Should alerts go to Telegram instead of email? | Ankit | Email for V1; Telegram webhook is future enhancement |

## Test Strategy Summary

### Test Approach

This epic is **infrastructure-only** with no application code changes. Testing is entirely **manual validation** using a checklist approach.

### Test Levels

| Level | Applicable | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Unit Tests | No | No application code changes |
| Integration Tests | No | Infrastructure configuration only |
| E2E Tests | No | Manual validation sufficient |
| Manual Validation | Yes | Primary test method |

### Coverage Summary

| Story | Test Method | Coverage Target |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 17.1 | Config validation, code review | 100% of ACs |
| 17.2 | Manual testing of all paths | 100% of ACs |
| 17.3 | Manual testing of all commands | 100% of ACs |

| ENV=prod with LOKI_URL=REPLACE_ME | Fail fast with config instructions | Manual |
| ENV=staging (invalid) | Treated as dev mode | Manual |
| Grafana Cloud unreachable | Containers start, logs buffered locally | Manual (disconnect network) |
| Very long log lines (>64KB) | Truncated by Loki driver | Optional manual test |

### Health Check Integration

The existing `/health/full` endpoint should be extended to report cloud logging status in production mode:

**Proposed Addition to Health Check Response** (Story 17.4 scope):
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "components": {
    // ... existing components ...
    "cloud_logging": {
      "enabled": true,           // ENV=prod
      "provider": "grafana_loki",
      "status": "configured"     // LOKI_URL is set
    }
  }
}
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Health check reads `ENV` and `LOKI_URL` from environment
- Does NOT ping Grafana Cloud (avoid adding latency to health checks)
- Reports `enabled: false` in dev mode
- Reports `status: "not_configured"` if `LOKI_URL` missing in prod
